# ITSDR
Code for analysis in Section 5 of Ghosh, "Sufficient dimension reduction: an information-theoretic viewpoint."

The csv files contain the data needed to run the analyses.   The sdrcode.R is the R script used to perform the analyses.  
Note that the csv files and sdrcode.R need to be in the same working directory where R is being run.

Note that the sdrcode.R script requires that you have installed the dr and pls packages from CRAN
(https://cran.r-project.org).
